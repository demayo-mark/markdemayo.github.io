## About
I’m a hardware-focused engineering professional with hands-on experience in **high-voltage battery testing**, **test execution**, **debugging**, and **data-driven validation**. I build practical systems end-to-end—from requirements and schematics to bring-up, measurement, and documentation.

**Core strengths:** Test engineering • Validation • Troubleshooting • Lab instrumentation • Automation mindset

## Featured Projects

### 1) 5-Channel TDM-PCM Communication System
**What it is:** Built a discrete-logic TDM-PCM system with receiver-side serial-to-parallel conversion and analog reconstruction.  
**Tech:** 74164 (SIPO), 4017 (counter), 4066/4016 (analog switches), 8-bit DAC, LPF reconstruction, oscilloscope validation  
**Highlights:**
- Implemented round-robin channel selection and synchronized sampling
- Validated reconstructed waveforms and filter behavior vs. expectations
- Documented design constraints and improvement path
